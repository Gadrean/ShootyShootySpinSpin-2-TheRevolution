# Shooty Shooty Spin Spin 2: The Revolution
A game I made in Year 13 Using Adobe Flash and actionscript 3. 

## Aim of the Game
The point is to get the highest score. You get 1 point for every enemy you destroy.

The player starts with 100 health and once you get to 0 the game ends.

Enemies spawn in waves each wave has one more enemy than the previous wave. Though currently there are only 2 waves, the initial wave and the boss wave.

There is a boss enemy in the final wave. However, it was never fully implemented. Currently it just follows the player around and changes size if it touches the player.

## Enemies

There are three types of enemies plus the boss.

Aspects of each enemy are slightly randomised, e.g. movement speed or how often, how much, and how long it shoots for.

Enemy bullets can deal damage to eachother so they can be used against eachother. However, they do not deal damage to the boss.

### Tringle

This is a triangular enemy that chases the player around and does damage when it manages to hit the player. Fairly fast but the player can usually stay away from them.

### Square

This is a square shaped enemy it also chases the player. However instead of hitting the player this enemy shoots shorts bursts of bullets at the player. It stops moving every time it shoots.

### Hexagonal

This enemy is hexagon shaped and cannot move. It shoots long streams of bullets at the player, with bigger gaps bettween bursts than the square.

### Helath

The boss is a decagon. Currently it slowly follows the player around, if the player touches the boss it will randomly change size, either getting bigger or smaller. 

It does no damage to the player.  

## Controls

The player is controlled using the mouse and the keyboard.

The player points towards the mouse cursor which is used to aim where you are shooting.

Left click is used to shoot.

The WASD keys are used to move around the screen.
